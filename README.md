# Named Entity Recognition

## AIM

To develop an LSTM-based model for recognizing the named entities in the text.

## Problem Statement and Dataset


## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Download and load the dataset to colab.

### STEP 2:
Scale the data using MinMaxScaler

### STEP 3:
Split the data into train and test.

### STEP 4:
Build the LSTM based recurrent neural network

### STEP 5:
Train the model with training data

### STEP 6:
Evaluate the model with the testing data

### STEP 7:
Plot the Stock prediction plot
